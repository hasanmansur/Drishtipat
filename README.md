# Drishtipat (দৃষ্টিপাত)

This repository is a collection of assignments which have been done as a part of the graduate course "Computer Vision".
The name "Drishtipat" is based on a Bengali word দৃষ্টিপাত, which means "to have a look at something" :-)

The completed assignments cover the following topics:
